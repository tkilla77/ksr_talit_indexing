# Information Retrieval

Code accompanying https://sca.ksr.ch/doku.php?id=talit:retrieval (in German).

There are currently four chapters:
  1. [Indexing](01_indexing.ipynb) - Building primary and secondary indices, and using binary search to implement range queries.
  2. [Trees](02_trees.ipynb) - Using binary search trees (BSTs) for range queries.
  3. [K-D-Trees](03_kd_trees.ipynb) - Expanding the BST concept to multiple dimensions.
  4. [Fulltext Indexing](04_text_indexing.ipynb) - Indexing and ranking text documents.

If you just want to play with the algorithms and one of three differently-sized datasets, have a look at the [playground](playground.ipynb).
